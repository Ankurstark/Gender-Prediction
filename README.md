*About Gender Recognition*

Gender Recognition is a python script that can detect the gender of a speaker from the voice given using Logistic Regression. It is trained using the voice kaggle set and uses pyaudio to record and extract the features from audio segments. Detecting the gender of a person (male or female) through their voice seems to be a very trivial task for humans. Our minds are trained over the course of time to detect the differences in voices of males and females. But it is a challenging problem for computers. So the prime motivation of this project is to detect the gender of the speaker that can be used for the Video Games and Mobile Applications.

The training data is used to train the model with the important attributes using the logistic regression technique. The whole dataset is considered as the training data and the voice given as input is considered as the test data. The background sounds that is considered as the noise will be eliminated while predicting the gender of the speaker. The approach allows an algorithm being used in a machine learning application to classify incoming data based on historical data. As more relevant data comes in, the algorithm should get better at predicting classifications within data sets.
